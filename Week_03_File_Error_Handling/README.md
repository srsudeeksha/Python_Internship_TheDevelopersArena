# Week 3 – File Handling & Error Handling

## 📅 Internship Week 3 Task
**Goal:** Learn how to read/write data to files and handle errors gracefully.  

This week, I learned about:
- Opening, reading, and writing files in Python (`open()`, `read()`, `write()`)
- Using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks for error handling
- Managing text files (`.txt`) to store and retrieve data
- Handling `FileNotFoundError` and other exceptions

## 📂 Files in this Folder

### 1️⃣ `contact_book.py`
A simple contact book program that:
- Stores names and phone numbers in a text file
- Allows adding new contacts
- Displays saved contacts
- Handles file errors (e.g., missing file)
- Prevents the program from crashing due to bad input or file issues

**How to run:**
python contact_book.py


You will be prompted to:
1. Add a new contact (name and phone number)
2. View all saved contacts
3. Exit the program

Contacts are stored in `contacts.txt` in the same folder.
